To use the API, API endpoint and token are required. Refer to [API usage preparations](/Compute/Compute/ko/identity-api/) to prepare the information required to use the API.

The logger and logging port APIs use endpoints of type `network`. See the `serviceCatalog` in the token issuance response for the exact endpoint.

| Type | Region | Endpoint |

## Flow log logging port

* Flow log logging ports are the ports that the flow log logger is capturing. A single flow log logger whose resource_type is either VPC or Subnet will manage multiple flow log logging ports.
* When a user creates or deletes a logger, Flow Log internally checks the ports that belong to that logger and adds or deletes them as logging port targets. This eliminates the need for the user to add or delete logging ports manually.
* The flow log logging port provides a lookup API only.

## Error type

If the environment you are trying to use the flow log in is not set up correctly, you might get an error. In this case, you can look up flowlog_logger.error_type to determine the cause of the error.


The status and error types of the flow log logger are as follows.

| Flow log logger status | Error type | Error cause | Checklist |
| :---: | --- | --- | --- |
| ACTIVE | - | - | - | - |
| BUILD | - | - | - | - |
| ERROR | AuthenticationSystemError | There's a problem with the authentication system. Please contact the Customer Center. | The flow log system account did not receive a token from the Keystone server. |
| ERROR | OBSConfigurationError | Check the OBS URL and access policy. | Dummy data was sent to the user's storage but a 403 error was returned because there was no access permission to OBS. Check the container URL and access policy. |
| ERROR | OBSServiceNotAvailableError | The OBS service is not working. Please contact the Customer Center. | Dummy data was sent to the user's storage but an error was returned other than 401 and 403. |
