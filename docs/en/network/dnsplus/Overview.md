DNS Plus is a DNS that users around the world can access fast and reliably. DNS Plus supports anycast networks so that users can access DNS fast and reliably from anywhere, and allows you to provide a DNS service directly from the web console without a separate DNS solution or server.

## Key Features

- DNS
    - You can perform DNS configuration in the web console without installing a separate DNS server.
    - It supports anycast networks so that you can provide a service at high speed in Korea as well as in other countries.
    - Because it is designed to accept a high volume of DNS queries, it can process a high volume of DNS queries and also mitigate DDoS attacks targeting DNS.
    > **[Note] Purchase a domain for DNS service usage**
    > To start using the DNS service, you must first have a domain. You cannot purchase a new domain name with the DNS service so you must purchase a domain from a domain registrar. (For details on how to register a domain name, see [Korea Internet & Security Agency's Domain Name Registration](https://xn--3e0bx5euxnjje69i70af08bea817g.xn--3e0b707e/jsp/business/management/domain/registrationInfo.jsp).)

- GSLB
    - DNS Plus GSLB (global server load balancing) is a service that performs reliable load balancing of traffic to endpoints based on DNS service.
    - It supports various routing rules.

    | Routing Rule | Description | Details |
    |---|---|---|
    | FAILOVER | Performs routing based on the priorities of pools connected to the GSLB domain. |  |
    | RANDOM | Performs routing by randomly selecting an available pool among pools connected to the GSLB domain. |  |
    | GEOLOCATION | Routes the traffic of the configured region to the connected pool.<br>When there is no configured region, performs routing based on the priorities of connected pools. | < Available Regions ><br>\- Western North America<br>\- Eastern North America<br>\- Western Europe<br>\- Eastern Europe<br>\- Northern South America<br>\- Southern South America<br>\- Oceania<br>\- Middle East<br>\- Northern Africa<br>\- Southern Africa<br>\- India<br>\- Southeast Asia<br>\- Northeast Asia |

    - Endpoint grouping through pool
        - You can use pools to group endpoints according to specific purposes.
        - Weights can be set for each endpoint included in the pool.

    - Supports various endpoint health check functions
        - Supports a reliable service by performing health checks of endpoints included in the pool using HTTP/HTTPS/TCP
        - For HTTP health checks, you can set the port, path, expected status code, and expected response body.
        - For HTTPS health checks, you can set the certificate validity, port, path, expected status code, and expected response body.

## Service Targets

- DNS
    - If you're developing an application provided for global users
    - When it is burdensome to manage and maintain DNS servers

- GSLB
    - If you want reliable load balancing of service traffic
    - If you want load balancing of global service traffic
    - If you want to configure disaster recovery (DR) through load balancing

## Service Terms

| Term | Description |
|---|---|
| Domain | A method of representing an address that identifies a computer on a network in a human-recognizable form. |
| DNS Zone | The domain zone of the host served by DNS. A container for record sets, which contains how to route traffic of domain and subdomain. |
| Record set | The information of host served by DNS Zone, which is how to route traffic of a domain. |
| Record set type | A resource type that indicates how to route traffic of a host. |
| Record value | Description of how to route the traffic of a host. The input content is determined by the record set type (resource type), and one or more values can be registered except for a specific type. |
| GSLB domain | An abbreviation of global server load balancing domain. It is a domain that can be used by mapping the CNAME to the service domain (record set) created by DNS Plus. |
| Pool | A component that groups endpoints, which is the smallest unit to which a routing rule is applied. Endpoints included in the pool are load balanced according to their weight. |
| Endpoint | Refers to the server that handles the actual traffic. Endpoints are available in the form of IP or domain. |
| Health check | A component that checks accessibility for endpoints belonging to a pool according to the configured value. |

## DNS Concepts
The domain name system (DNS) is the system responsible for mapping between host names (such as www.example.com) and IP addresses (such as 192.168.1.1) in a computer network.

How DNS works is as follows.
1. Enter domain name: The user enters the domain name (for example, www.example.com) in a web browser.
2. DNS query: The user's computer sends a query to the DNS server to resolve the entered domain name.
3. Search DNS server: The user’s computer sends a query to a DNS server, usually one that belongs to Internet service provider (ISP). If this DNS server knows the IP address mapped to the domain name, it returns that IP address. If not, it sends another query to a higher-level DNS server to find the IP address.
4. Forward response: The DNS server forwards the IP address it finds to the user’s computer.
5. Connect to a web server: The user’s computer uses the IP address it found to connect to a web server in that domain.
