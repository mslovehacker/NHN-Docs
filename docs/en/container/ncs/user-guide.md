<a id="considerations"></a>
## Other considerations

<a id="considerations-region"></a>
### Region

* NCS service is only available in Korea (Pangyo) and Korea (Gwangju) region.

<a id="considerations-resource-provision-policy"></a>
### Resource Provision Policy
* Refer to [ NHN Container Service Resource Provision Policy](/nhncloud/en/resource-policy/#nhn-container-servicencs).

<a id="considerations-template-container"></a>
### Template/Container

* Containers described in Template must be configured to use different container ports.
* If you connect directly to Container Port, make sure that Security Group is well set up.
* You cannot create Load Balancer if you use Template that does not specify Container Port.
* You can create containers by utilizing Container images that exist in the following Private Registry.
* Containers can be created by using container images that exist in private registries. The supported source registry types, URLs, Access IDs, and Access Secrets are as follows.

| Source Registry Type | Access ID | Access Secret |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Azure Container Registry | Access Key User Name | Access Key Password |
| Google Cloud Container Registry | \_json_key | Private key of service account (JSON type) |
| Docker Hub | Username | Password |
| Harbor | Username | Password |
| Quay | json_file | {<br>"account_name": "$User account",<br>"docker_cli_password": "Encrypted Password generated by $Quay"<br>} |

* Within Container image, you must match Container Port in the Template with the Port that the Container decides to use for service.
    * If you use default nginx Container image that is designated to serve 80 ports, you have to specify 80 for the Container Port. If you change the content of Container image and set it up to serve another Port, you have to specify that Port number.
* Configmaps and secrets use the information from when the template was created. If the original file or confidential data is modified, the information in the already created template is not affected.
    * To update the contents of Configmaps and secrets and reflect those changes, you need to create a new template or version and run the workload.

## Guide to Problem Solving

Explain how to solve various problems that may occur while using the NCS service

<a id="problem-solving-workload"></a>
### Workload

* A container event with **FailedCreatePodSandBox**/**CNITimedOutWaitingForVIFs** type occurs when the workload is created normally, and the container is running properly
    * This event occurs when Network Interface for use in NCS is not created. This is a temporary event that occurs when a workload is created immediately after template creation or when a workload is created in bulk. The event does not occur after a certain amount of time has elapsed.
* A container event with **IpAddressGenerationFailure** type occurs when the workload is pending
    * This event occurs when there are no more IP addresses available in the specified subnet. You must create Template by changing the CIDR of the subnet or using other subnet.
* Workloads remain pending after changing the workload template
    * You can check the **Event** of the added task to find why the container is not running.
* An event where creating workloads fails due to insufficient resources

| Error Message | Descriptions |
| --- | --- |
| {{.Resource}} Could not create a workload due to insufficient resources. | Could not create a workload due to insufficient resources for NCS environment.<br>Try again after a while or contact the Customer Center. |
| Exceeded the number of {{.Resource}} that can be created. Please contact the Customer Center to increase the limit. | Exceeded the NCS quota for the project.<br>For more details, refer to [NHN Container Service(NCS) Resource Provision Policy](/nhncloud/en/resource-policy/#nhn-container-servicencs). |

## Integrate with NHN Cloud Service

### Integrate with Log & Crash Search Service

When workloads are deleted or restarted, logs are deleted and cannot be viewed. To back up important logs or to search and view specific logs, you can integrate with the Log & Crash Search (L&C) service.

The following describes how to create a logging agent (FluentBit, Logstash) as a sidecar container and integrate it with L&C.

For more information about FluentBit, see [Fluent Bit: Official Manual](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/).
For more information about Logstash, see [Logstash Reference](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/index.html).
To learn how to use Log & Crash Search, see the [Log & Crash Search Console User Guide](/Data%20&%20Analytics/Log%20&%20Crash%20Search/en/console-guide/).

> [Note]
> We've described how to create logs as a file on temporary shared storage between containers.
> If you generate container logs as files, you cannot view them in the Logs tab of the workload.

<a id="integration-through-fluentbit"></a>
#### Integration through FluentBit

* In order for FluentBit to work with L&C, you need to create a configuration file. Create a configuration file as shown below and upload it to Object Storage.

```ini
[SERVICE]
    Flush 1
    Daemon Off
    Log_Level warn
    Parsers_File parsers.conf
    Plugins_File plugins.conf
    HTTP_Server Off

[INPUT].
    Name tail
    Path /var/{workload name}/{log file name}

[OUTPUT]
    Name http
    Match * Β
    Host api-logncrash.cloud.toast.com
    Port 443
    URI /v2/log
    Format json
    Log_response_payload false
    Tls On
    Tls.verify Off

[FILTER]
    Name modify
    Match * Β
    Rename log body
    Add host ${HOSTNAME}
    Add projectName {L&C AppKey}
    Add projectVersion {Customized project version}
    Add logVersion {log format version}
    Add logType {log type}
    Add logSource {Log Source}
    Add logLevel {Log Level}
```

* Create by adding a container to the template as shown below.

| Items | alpine (create log) | fluentbit (send og) |
| --- | -------------- | ----------------- |
| Containers Name | alpine | fluentbit |
| Image URL | alpine:latest | fluent/fluent-bit:2.2.1 |
| Order | To write the log to a file, enter as follows.<ul><li>sh,-c,while true; do echo "hello world" >> /var/{workload name}/{log file name}; sleep 1; done</li></ul> |  |
| ConfigMap |  | Add information to import the fluentbit configuration file that you uploaded to Object Storage.<br>Enter the container mount path as follows.<ul><li>/fluent-bit/etc/fluent-bit.conf</li></ul> |

* When you create a workload with that template, the logs generated by alpine can be searched and viewed in L&C.

<a id="integration-through-logstash"></a>
#### Integration through Logstash

* In order for Logstash to work with L&C, you need to create a configuration file. Create a configuration file as shown below and upload it to Object Storage.

```ini
input {
  file {
    path => "/var/{workload name}/{log filename}
    start_position => "beginning"
    ignore_older => 0
  }
}

filter {
  mutate {
    remove_field => [ "@version", "@timestamp", "path", "tags" ]
    rename => {
      "message" => "body"
      "host" => "host"
    }
    add_field => {
      "projectName" => "{L&C AppKey}"
      "projectVersion" => "{Customized project version}"
      "logVersion" => "{Log format version}"
      "logType" => "{Log Type}"
      "logSource" => "{Log Source}"
      "logLevel" => "{Log Level}"
    }
  }
}

output {
  http {
    url => "https://api-logncrash.cloud.toast.com/v2/log"
    http_method => "post"
    format => "json"
    ssl_verification_mode => "none"
  }
}
```

* Create by adding a container to the template as shown below.

| Items | alpine (create log) | logstash (send log) |
| --- | -------------- | ---------------- |
| Containers Name | alpine | logstash |
| Image URL | alpine:latest | logstash:8.11.0 |
| Memory | 256 | 1024 |
| Order | To write the log to a file, enter as follows.<ul><li>sh,-c,while true; do echo "hello world" >> /var/{workload name}/{log file name}; sleep 1; done</li></ul> |  |
| Environment Variables |  | XPACK_MONITORING_ENABLED : false |
| ConfigMap |  | Add information to import the logstash configuration file that you uploaded to Object Storage.<br>Enter the container mount path as follows.<ul><li>/usr/share/logstash/pipeline/logstash.conf</li></ul> |

* When you create a workload with that template, the logs generated by alpine can be searched and viewed in L&C.
