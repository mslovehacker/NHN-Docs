## Scheduled Task

A scheduled task function is provided so that a specific task can be started at a desired time. The scheduled task runs at the task schedule time, but is not guaranteed to be completed within the task schedule time.

### Scheduled Task Status

The status types of scheduled tasks are as follows:

| Status         | Description                                      |
|------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Scheduled        | The task has been scheduled, before it is task schedule time.                   |
| Registered        | The state before the task starts, when it is task schedule time.                  |
