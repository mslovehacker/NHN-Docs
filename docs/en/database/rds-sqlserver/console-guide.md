## DB Instances

On the DB Instances tab, you can create, modify, or delete database (DB) instances, or query status information of created DB instances.

### Create a DB Instance

To create a DB instance, click **Create DB Instance** on top left of the list to go to page for DB instance creation.
Enter specifications, information, network, floating IP, DB security group, and backup settings for the instance, click **Create DB Instance** and send a request for creation.

![Create DB Instance 001](https://static.toastoven.net/prod_rds_mssql/20230110/db_instance_create_001_kr.png)

## Appendix 1. DB Instance Migration Guide for Hypervisor Maintenance

NHN Cloud periodically updates the hypervisor software of the DB instance to improve security and stability.
DB instances running on a hypervisor that requires maintenance must be migrated to the hypervisor where maintenance has been completed.

You can start DB instance migration from the NHN Cloud console.
Follow the guide below to use the migration feature in the console.
First, go to the project where the DB instance requiring maintenance is located.

### 1. Check the DB instance that requires maintenance.

A DB instance with a **Migrate** button next to its name is the instance that requires maintenance.

![planned migration 001](https://static.toastoven.net/prod_rds_mssql/20211109/planned_migration_001.png)

You can check the detailed maintenance schedule by hovering the mouse cursor over the **Migrate** button.

![planned migration 002](https://static.toastoven.net/prod_rds_mssql/20211109/planned_migration_002.png)

### 2. Stop applications connected to the DB instance that requires maintenance.

Take appropriate measures not to affect services connected to the DB.
If there is no way to do so without affecting the services, please contact the NHN Cloud Customer Center and we will guide you through the appropriate action.

### 3. Request migration of the DB instance that requires maintenance.

Click the **Migrate** button next to the DB instance that requires maintenance. When a confirmation window appears, click the **Migrate** button.

![planned migration 003](https://static.toastoven.net/prod_rds_mssql/20211109/planned_migration_003.png)

### 4. Wait for the DB instance migration to finish.

If the status of DB instance does not change, try clicking the 'refresh' button.

![planned migration 004](https://static.toastoven.net/prod_rds_mssql/20211109/planned_migration_004.png)

No operations can be performed on the DB instance while migration is in progress.
If the DB instance migration is not completed normally, it is automatically reported to the administrator, and NHN Cloud will contact you.
