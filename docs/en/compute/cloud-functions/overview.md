Users can write codes by function unit. Functions defined on a specific event are automatically executed, processing the required tasks. Without server management or infrastructure configuration, you can focus only on application logic.

### Features
- Cost-effectiveness
    - Save money with pay-as-you-go pricing.
    - You can reduce management cost as it allocates resources only when necessary.
    - Scale up and down automatically on demand to keep operating efficiently.
- Rapid development and deployment
    - Focus on the core business logic.
    - Shorten the development speed by reducing the burden of DevOps operation.
- Flexibility and scalability
    - Support for multiple languages and runtimes.
    - The event-based architecture is versatile.

### Main features
- We offer multiple languages (environments).
- The **code editor** makes you write simple function unit code.
- Provide an HTTPS Endpoint as standard to perform the function.
- Iterate the function at regular cycles.

### Two modes available
- Pool Manager
- New Deployment
#### Pool Manager
- Instances are created and use resources only when the function is performed.
- If the function is not performed for a certain period, instances disappear, and the resource usage becomes 0.
- Use it only when the number of requests is small to perform the function and event occurs.

#### New Deployment
- Once functions are created, instances are created, keeping a certain amount of resources being used.
- Instances are kept to reduce response latency.
- Use it when the number of requests is large to perform the function and a quick response is needed.
